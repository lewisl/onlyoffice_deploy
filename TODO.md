# OnlyOffice Deployment Toolkit - Current Status

  ## Completed Tasks
  - ✅ Phase 1: Complete container dependency diagram
  - ✅ Phase 1: Volume mapping inventory (host → container paths)
  - ✅ Phase 1: Network topology documentation
  - ✅ Phase 1: Docker-compose structure analysis
  - ✅ Phase 1: Configuration file locations mapping
  - ✅ Phase 4: SSL architecture discovery and testing
  - ✅ Phase 2: Create encrypted storage setup script
  - ✅ Phase 3: Create onlyoffice-status.sh script
  - ✅ Phase 3: Create container lifecycle management scripts
  - ✅ Phase 3: Create container health and diagnostics scripts

  ## Next Tasks (New Droplet)
  - [ ] New droplet: Verify OnlyOffice 1-click installation running
  - [ ] New droplet: Install git and clone toolkit to /root/onlyoffice_deploy
  - [ ] New droplet: Detach storage from old droplet, attach to new droplet
  - [ ] New droplet: Test toolkit scripts against working OnlyOffice
  - [ ] Phase 2: Implement automated encrypted storage migration
  - [ ] Phase 4: Design and implement SSL automation
  - [ ] Phase 5: Create operations documentation

  ## Key Notes
  - SSL is NOT part of default 1-click install
  - OnlyOffice will initially use local storage, not attached block storage
  - This is perfect for testing Phase 2 storage migration automation
